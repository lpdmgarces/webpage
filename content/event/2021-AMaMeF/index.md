abstract: "We price European and American exchange options when the underlying asset prices are modelled as Merton (1976) jump-diffusion process with a common Heston (1993) stochastic volatility process. Pricing is performed under an equivalent martingale measure obtained by taking the second asset yield process as the numeraire, as suggested by the put-call transformation technique suggested by Bjerskund and Stensland (1993). Under this equivalent martingale measure, we derive the exchange option pricing integro-partial differential equations (IPDEs) and investigate the early exercise boundary of the American exchange option. We then discuss a numerical solution of the IPDEs using the method of lines (MOL) its implementation using computing software. Our analytical and numerical investigation shows that the near-maturity behavior of the early exercise boundary of the American exchange option is significantly influenced by the dividend yields and the presence of jumps in the underlying asset prices. Furthermore, with the numerical results generated by the MOL, we are able to show that key jump and stochastic volatility parameters significantly affect the early exercise boundary and exchange option prices. Our numerical analysis also verifies that the MOL performs more eciently, compared to other finite difference methods or simulation approaches for American options, since the MOL integrates the computation of option prices, greeks, and the early exercise boundary and does so with the least error."
