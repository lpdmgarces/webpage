abstract: "There is substantial empirical evidence showing that the geometric Brownian motion assumption of the classical Black-Scholes-Merton model is inadequate in characterizing the full extent of asset price returns observed in the market. As such, recent years have seen a rise in the pricing of options and other financial derivatives using alternative asset price models, including jump-diffusion models, stochastic volatility models, and stochastic volatility jump-diffusion models.

To this end, we examine the price of European and American exchange options under the assumption of stochastic volatility and jump-diffusion (SVJD) dynamics for the underlying asset prices. We also describe parameter restrictions on the instantaneous variance processes and the instantaneous correlation coefficients to ensure that the variances do not explode or make excursions to zero in finite time under any probability measure equivalent to the market measure. Given the risk-neutral dynamics of asset prices and the instantaneous variances, we derive the exchange option pricing integro-partial differential equation (IPDE) and present appropriate initial, boundary, and smooth-fit conditions.

Using a change-of-numeraire approach, we obtain a representation for the European exchange option price in terms of probabilities (under probability measures equivalent to the risk-neutral measure) that the option is in-the-money.  We note that our result has a form similar to Margrabe's formula for European exchange option prices under pure diffusion processes. We also analyze the American case and verify that the American exchange option price can be written in terms of an early exercise representation. We find that the associated early exercise premium can be decomposed into a diffusion and a jump part, consistent with earlier results on American calls and puts.

The analytical results presented here lay the foundation for a future numerical and statistical analysis of exchange option prices under SVJD dynamics."
