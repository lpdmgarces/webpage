This project is intended to augment current technology tools and resources by creating learning apps/applets, and to enhance the teachers’ competencies by providing teaching guides for the Grades 7-10 mathematics curriculum in the Philippines. The teaching guides, which are designed based on the mathematics competencies prescribed by the Philippine’s Department of Education, aim to optimize the use of the apps/applets, and the benefits that come with it.

Implemented by researchers from Ateneo de Manila University and the University of Southern Mindanao, this project is funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) – Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development (PCIEERD)
