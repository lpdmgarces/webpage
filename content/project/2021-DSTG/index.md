We investigate various approaches for simulation meta-modelling for continuous and discrete output metrics in the presence of correlation and heterogeneity. We also propose models to characterize causality in temporally indexed events. 

This project is part of a Defence Science Partnership with the Commonwealth of Australia (represented by the Defence Science Technology Group) and the University of South Australia.
