# summary: This is my PhD project at the University of South Australia. In this project, I derive analytical representations of European and American exchange options when the underlying asset price processes are modelled as stochastic volatility and jump-diffusion dynamics. I also propose several numerical methods to compute exchange option prices under these dynamics, as a closed-form expression for option prices is not available.

We investigate various approaches for simulation meta-modelling for continuous and discrete output metrics in the presence of correlation and heterogeneity. We also propose models to characterize causality in temporally indexed events. 

This project is part of a Defence Science Partnership with the Commonwealth of Australia (represented by the Defence Science Technology Group) and the University of South Australia.
