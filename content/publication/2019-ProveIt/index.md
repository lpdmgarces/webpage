abstract: This paper presents apps designed to assist students in understanding and developing proofs in geometric theorems. These technologies focus on triangle congruence, triangle similarity and properties of parallelograms. Focus group discussions and initial testing of the apps revealed that the apps offered a more engaging medium for learning proving and were capable of facilitating proof-writing skills in geometry.
