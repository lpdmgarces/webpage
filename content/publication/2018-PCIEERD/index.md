abstract: This article describes a Department of Science and Technology – Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology (DOST-PCIEERD) project aimed to facilitate the implementation of the mathematical objectives raised by the Department of Education’s (DepEd) K to 12 program in the Philippines through the use of innovative digital technologies. In particular, a selection of application software (“apps”) were created for Grade 7 to 10 mathematics that covered topics indicated in the five strands outlined in the K to 12 program – namely (1) number, (2) geometry, (3) measurement, (4) patterns and algebra, and (5) statistics and probability. The design of the apps was informed by an amalgamated framework of the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (Mayer 2005) and Mathematical Theories of Representation (Goldin 1998). The design was informed by how students learn and how students learn mathematics. The project also aimed to design manipulable software that allows learners to construct and grapple with their mental representations of mathematical concepts. This paper describes a selection of the apps designed by the project and how their features were informed by the theoretical framework. It also presents results from pilot studies that demonstrate the apps’ potential to increase performance, facilitate conceptual development, and increase learners’ engagement.
